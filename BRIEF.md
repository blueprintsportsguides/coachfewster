CURSOR BUILD BRIEF
Football Coaching Website

Location focused: Egham and surrounding areas
Primary goal: Enquiries and bookings
Secondary goal: Trust, professionalism, clarity

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a modern, premium football coaching website for a personal coach based in Egham, offering private, small group, party, and camp sessions for young players.

The site must feel:

Professional and trustworthy

Modern, clean, and current

Friendly but high-level

Parent-facing first, player-focused second

The website should work perfectly on mobile first, while also scaling beautifully on desktop.

This is not a generic coaching site. It should feel intentional, well-designed, and premium without being corporate.

2. TARGET AUDIENCE

Primary:

Parents of children aged approx. 6–16

Parents looking for confidence, development, and enjoyment

Parents in and around Egham and nearby areas

Secondary:

Young players themselves

Schools, clubs, and event organisers

Tone:

Reassuring

Confident

Supportive

Clear and simple

Never salesy or gimmicky

3. UNIVERSAL THEME & UI DIRECTION
Visual Style

Clean, modern sports aesthetic

White or very light background base

Dark charcoal or near-black primary text

One strong accent colour (deep green, navy, or muted blue)

Plenty of spacing and breathing room

Rounded corners on cards and image frames

Subtle shadows, not heavy effects

Typography

Modern sans-serif

Strong hierarchy

Large, confident headings

Clear readable body text

Avoid overly playful fonts

Buttons

Solid primary buttons

Clear calls to action

Rounded edges

Strong contrast

Hover and tap feedback

Layout Principles

Card-based sections

Clear vertical rhythm

Modular blocks that can be reused across pages

Sections should stack cleanly on mobile

No clutter

4. IMAGE PLACEHOLDER REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT)

Throughout the site:

Use image frames / placeholder blocks instead of real images

Use simple shapes that fit the UI (rounded rectangles, cards, split layouts)

Label placeholders clearly in comments or alt text, for example:

"Hero image placeholder"

"Coaching action image placeholder"

"Small group session image placeholder"

Do not source or embed real images. These will be added after build.

Copy direction:

Football has always been a huge part of my life. After a knee injury and the unexpected pause of the COVID lockdown, my journey naturally shifted from playing to coaching. What initially felt like a setback became a turning point. I found a real passion for helping others grow, build confidence, and enjoy football in a positive environment.

Since then, I have focused on delivering sessions that are supportive, structured, and tailored to each individual. The goal is always the same: help players feel confident on the pitch and proud of their progress.

Coaching Values Section

Examples:

Confidence First
